<h1> System Design RoadMap </h1>

> System Design, particularly in the realm of Large Scale Design, is a complex and demanding field that often presents challenges for engineers, who face difficulties in acquiring the requisite knowledge, honing their design skills, and tackling real-world system design problems. As a solution to this, I have developed a comprehensive roadmap in the form of a chart, which serves as a guide for engineers seeking to accelerate their learning process in large-scale design, ultimately leading them to enhance their expertise and become more proficient engineers.
